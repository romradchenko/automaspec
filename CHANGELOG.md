## How To Read This

Entries are grouped by version, and within a version by category:

- `Added`: New functionality, endpoints, UI, or developer tooling.
- `Changed`: Behavior changes that are not necessarily fixes.
- `Deprecated`: Announcements of future breaking changes and their timeline.
- `Removed`: Functionality removed (usually after a deprecation period).
- `Fixed`: Bug fixes.
- `Security`: Security fixes and hardening.

If a change affects upgrade steps, it should be called out explicitly in `Deprecated`, `Removed`, or `Changed`.
