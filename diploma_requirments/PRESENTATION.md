**Must show:**
- Main screens of the application
- Key user flow (e.g., registration → main action → result)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Read slides word-by-word | Use slides as visual support |
| Put entire paragraphs on slides | Use short bullet points (5–7 words) |
| Use tiny fonts | Minimum 18pt body, 24pt+ headers |
| Show raw code (20+ lines) | Show key snippets (5–10 lines) or pseudocode |
| Skip the "why" | Always explain your decisions |
| Use generic diagrams from internet | Create diagrams specific to your project |
| Leave empty sections | Mark N/A with explanation if something doesn't apply |
