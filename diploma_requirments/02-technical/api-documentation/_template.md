# Criterion: [Criterion Name]

> Copy this template for each evaluation criterion. Rename the file to match the criterion (e.g., `backend.md`, `frontend.md`, `database.md`).

## Architecture Decision Record

### Status

**Status:** Accepted | Proposed | Deprecated | Superseded

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Context

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Why Not Chosen |
|-------------|------|------|----------------|
| [Option 1] | [Benefits] | [Drawbacks] | [Reason for rejection] |
| [Option 2] | [Benefits] | [Drawbacks] | [Reason for rejection] |
| [Option 3] | [Benefits] | [Drawbacks] | [Reason for rejection] |

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

**Negative:**
- [Drawback 1]
- [Drawback 2]

**Neutral:**
- [Observation that is neither positive nor negative]
