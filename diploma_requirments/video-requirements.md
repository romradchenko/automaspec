## Content Guidelines

### Do ✅

- Show the **actual working application**, not mockups
- Use **screen recordings** with smooth cursor movements
- Add **subtitles** for accessibility (even if there's voiceover)
- Keep **transitions smooth** but not distracting
- Maintain **good pacing** — no long pauses or rushed sections
- Use **annotations** (arrows, highlights) to draw attention to key elements

### Don't ❌

- Don't use copyrighted music without license
- Don't show sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personal info)
- Don't record low-quality screen captures (blurry, laggy)
- Don't exceed 2 minutes — shorter is better
- Don't include long code scrolling — show snippets only
- Don't use flashy transitions or effects excessively

## Production Tips

### Screen Recording
- Use OBS Studio, Loom, or built-in OS tools
- Record at native resolution (1080p or higher)
- Hide bookmarks bar, notifications, personal tabs
- Use a clean desktop background

### Audio (if included)
- Record in a quiet environment
- Use a decent microphone (even phone mic is OK if close)
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Normalize audio levels in editing

### Editing
- Cut out mistakes, pauses, loading times
- Add text overlays for key points
- Use consistent fonts: Arial, Helvetica, Montserrat, or similar
- Keep visual style consistent throughout

### If No Voiceover
- Use text cards to explain each section
- Add background music (royalty-free only)
- Use annotations and callouts on screen recordings
